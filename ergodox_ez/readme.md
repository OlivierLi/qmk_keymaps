This keymap is based on providing easy access to canadian mutltilingual characters on top of a default US keyboard.

## ShiftedR layer

This layer emulates the regular application of shift to characters on the right of the keyboard while disabling its
use to characters that would require typing with the wrong fingers because of their position. Shifting those characters
can be done with the right shift.
